Symbitcoin ("Symbiotic" + "bitcoin"): Bitcoin client with new symbiotic protocol rules riding on top of the existing bitcoin protocol to allow symbitcoin users to create new currencies which have a price target. 

For example, expect to see new distributed currencies which are pegged to the U.S. Dollar, the price of oil, gold, and eventually every possible currency, stock, and commodity.

Old bitcoin clients don't have to change or update, but their bitcoins will become much more valuable :)
